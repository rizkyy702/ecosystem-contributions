title: "Automated Governance Notifications"
description: "Current Challenge: The govNERDs team posts recurring announcements for voting cycles, including:
- New voting cycle beginnings
- Voting period openings
- 48-hour voting reminders
- Voting period conclusions
- Veto period communications
These require manual posting across Discord, Telegram, and other channels, consuming significant time.
Helpful features could include
Calendar Integration: Connecting to our governance calendar (Google Calendar/ICS feeds) to trigger announcements.
Multi-Channel Distribution: Posting simultaneously across Discord, Telegram, and potentially X (Twitter).
Template Management: Creating a library of announcement templates that can be edited before posting.
Notification Preferences: Allowing delegates to customize which announcements they receive.
